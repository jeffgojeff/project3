# Programming project 3: swing GUI for MovieReviewApp
* Due date: Monday May 11th 2p.m.

**Goal:** 

The goal of the project is to help students understand the concepts of Java GUI development.  We will use Java 11 native swing framework, and baseline code provided in git.txstate.edu/CS3354/src.git project3 folder.  


**Description** This assignment extends MovieReviewApp solution from previous project, by replacing console-based user interface with a graphical user interface (GUI). 

* All the operations remain the same as provided in instructor's code
* **You CAN modify  all .java files in the starting code of solution3 provided.** while keeping the same functionalities. 
* Use only Swing/AWT components and containers 
* The user input/output will be handled through a Swing-based Java GUI. 
* The decision regarding which Swing components should be used to achieve the required functionality is left to YOU! You can use examples in src.git folders: gui/animation, corejava/v1ch11, HW8/Calculator.java, concurrency/logging/LoggingImageViewer.java 
  

## Tasks:

### Task 1 Code Delivery 20 pt

* Submitted project3/*.java and project3/*.md files under CS3354/NetID.git repository - 5pt
* Code compiles and runs, top window displayed - 5 pt
* Javadoc to document the code and design changes - 5pt
* Use of standard Java coding style to improve your programâ€™s visual appearance and make it more readable e.g. https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html - 5pt

## Task 2 Functional GUI 60 pt 

Edit project3 java files so that all user input and output is handled through GUI.  STEPS:
* Edit MovieReviewApp.java so the class is the main user interface - MovieReviewApp class will have to be re-written from scratch. 
* Edit ReviewHandler.java so the class is the main controller class of the program.  ReviewHandler class will not require many changes.
* Use JTable swing component to visualize a set of Reviews. With the JTable class you can display tables of data, optionally allowing the user to edit the data. 
* You have fullk design freedom. 
* To receive full credit all functionalities need to work correctly. 

### Task 2 Design GUI component 20 pt 

* Edit GUI so that new app has a native look and feel using the components - 5 pt
* Native navigation, resizing - 5pt
* User-friendly design, graded on components and visual design choices - 10 pt
